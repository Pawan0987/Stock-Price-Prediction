# Stock-Price-Prediction
In this project, we have created a model to predict the stock price. It predicts the real time stock prices in the market.

Designed and built predictive models, including LSTMs and traditional machine learning algorithms, for accurate stock price forecasting.

Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed historical stock data, fine-tuned models, and incorporated error handling to ensure reliable performance and precise forecasting.

Evaluated predictions and created intuitive dashboards with accessible visualizations to present stock price trends and model comparisons effectively.
